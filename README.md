- Component files are automatically routed and compiled down
- To add styling, custom CSS files can be added to the src/styles/ folder and then imported into src/app.css, and src/app.css can also be modified directly. Classes and IDs can be added to any React components via "className" and "id".
  -e.g. `<ExampleComponent className="btn btn-success btn-lg" id="submitEmail">`
- src/index.js is the entry point of the program, and will act as the landing page.
- Placeholder images can be put into /tmp/dev-server/placeholder-images. Images can then be used freely in the JSX in the React components.
